Roy Stuart. The Leg Show Photos: Embrace Your Fantasies, Power Play by Dian Hanson Taboos: Busted

 The best of Roy Stuart‚Äôs Leg Show fantasy photos


 Between 1987 and 2001, Dian Hanson, then editor of Leg Show magazine, and photographer Roy Stuart collaborated on over 100 fetish photo shoots, producing an intensely sexual, socially transgressive body of work unmatched in contemporary erotic photography. Stuart, influenced by authors Angela Carter, William S. Burroughs, and Georges Bataille, was and remains passionately opposed to commercial pornography and insisted every photo story subvert and skewer some societally imposed sexual taboo. Women are portrayed with strength and sexual agency; men are often submissive; all are adventuresome and fluid. Hanson selected the wardrobe to appeal to a range of sexual tastes, including stocking, shoe, panty, nylon, and rubber fetishes. Viewed today, the styles and attitudes speak to the liberal hedonism of 1990s America, when, under the Clinton presidency, erotic artists were afforded more creative freedom.

Power Play , the first volume in the series Roy Stuart: Embrace Your Fantasies , showcases photo stories addressing sexual power dynamics. All images are from the original transparencies, rescued from the Leg Show archives before the magazine‚Äôs demise in 2012, and presented with Hanson‚Äôs original magazine text.


 Join us in a trip back to the prosperous, optimistic 1990s to explore your fantasies‚Äîand perhaps some you never considered‚Äîwith the richly produced sexual subversion of Roy Stuart and Dian Hanson.

 ‚Äú‚ÄòArt porn‚Äô almost universally fails to be either aesthetically satisfying or a turn-on‚Äîbut Roy Stuart bestrides both camps like an obscene and beguiling colossus, truly earning the title undisputed master of the genre.‚Äù

‚Äî Arena, London
