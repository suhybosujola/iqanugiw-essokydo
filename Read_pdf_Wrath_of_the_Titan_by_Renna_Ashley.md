Overview
*Previously published as Titan&#039;s Wrath by Lauryn Evans.*
 Supernatural meets Percy Jackson with mermaids and twist on fae in this new adult, contemporary/ urban romantasy from author Renna Ashley.

 A siren afraid of her voice. The hunter that didn&#039;t want to fall for her. And the prophecy that will bring them both to their knees.
 
 Nerissa &quot;Ris&quot; Daniels has always wanted to be normal. With a bright future ahead of her, she seems like any other college student. But what they don&#039;t know is, she sprouts a tail in saltwater. And her voice can kill.
 
 When two siren hunters kidnap her, Ris finally starts to get some answers. About what she is, why singing is so dangerous for her. And why her grandmother knows a lot more than she&#039;s letting on. All that was expected.
 
 What Ris didn&#039;t expect, was to get caught up in centuries-old titan drama. Not to mention falling for Logan Thomas, the siren hunter that tried to end her. The titan Okeanos plans to unleash his wrath upon the earth, and a seer&#039;s prophecy puts Ris right at the center. Meaning, she&#039;s the only one who can stop him. But all Ris wants is to graduate, get into a good law school, and maybe, live long enough to test the waters with Logan. She didn&#039;t ask for this chosen-one crap.
 
 But she doesn&#039;t have another choice, does she?
 
 Loosely inspired by figures from Greek mythology, Wrath of the Titan is the first book in a fast-paced, contemporary/urban romantic fantasy trilogy featuring reluctant allies, he falls first/harder, lovable side characters, multiple POVs, and spice levels that increase with each installment. This is the second edition of a novel previously published under a different pen name.
