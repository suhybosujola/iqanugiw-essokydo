 Opening like a fairy tale and ending like a nightmare, this cannonball of a queer coming-of-age novel follows a young man&amp;#039;s relationship with a violent older boyfriend‚Äîand how he and his sister survive a terrible crime
 
 After years of severed communication, Justin appears on his sister‚Äôs doorstep needing a place to stay. The home he&amp;#039;s made for himself has collapsed, as has everything else in his life. When they were children, Willa played the role of her brother‚Äôs protector, but now, afraid of the chaos he might bring, she‚Äôs reluctant to let him in.
 
 Willa lives a carefully ordered life working as a nurse and making ornate dioramas in her spare time. As Justin tries to connect with the people she‚Äôs closest to‚Äîher landlord, her boyfriend, their mother‚Äîshe begins to feel exposed. Willa and Justin‚Äôs relationship has always been strained yet loving, frustrating and close. But it hits a new breaking point when Justin spirals out of control, unable to manage his sobriety and the sustained effects of a brain injury.
 
 Years earlier, in high school, desperate to escape his home life and his disapproving, troubled mother, Justin falls into the hands of his first lover, a slightly older boy living on his own who offers Justin some semblance of intimacy and refuge. When Justin‚Äôs boyfriend commits a terrifying act of violence, the two flee on a doomed road trip, a journey that will damage Justin and change his and his family‚Äôs lives forever.
 
 Weaving together these two timelines, Brother &amp;amp; Sister Enter the Forest unravels the thread of a young man‚Äôs trauma and the love waiting for him on the other side.
