Overview
From the world of Push and Pull comes a new unexpected forbidden romance...
 
 My name is Tate Eckhart, and I love my life.
 I have a great job, a sick wardrobe. I drive a fancy car and sip scotch old enough to be my Daddy.
 I&#039;m fine with being known as the bad guy, the troublemaker, and the unattached harlot out of all my friends. Hey, if the Burberry loafer fits, right?
 Money, control... Sex, no strings attached. It&#039;s how I&#039;ve been living since that one night, back in college... When I stepped over a line with one of my closest friends, only to discover the truth.
 Love is for suckers.
 Who cares if he&#039;s abnormally beautiful and built like a Norse god? He ran out of my life after an incident that was very ungodly.
 But that&#039;s all in the past... Or at least, it was.
 Bumping into each other in the most unexpected of places has to be a coincidence; a humorous joke from the big guy upstairs. Because my old pal is now a pastor. And he&#039;s married... to a woman.
 Doesn&#039;t matter. I don&#039;t have time for relationships, feelings, or thinking about what could have been...
 But when we&#039;re alone, it seems like neither of us can practice what we preach. And what we do in secret feels damningly good.
 Keeping it going is asking for trouble...
 But I suppose if I&#039;m already on my knees, I might as well beg for forgiveness.
