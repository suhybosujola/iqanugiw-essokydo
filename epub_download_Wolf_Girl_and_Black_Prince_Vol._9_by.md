High school girl Erika may be on Kyoyaâ€™s leash, but sheâ€™s determined to break free and unleash his heart!
 
 Fed up with being hopelessly single, high schooler Erika makes up a boyfriend to fit in. When her lies start to unravel, her schoolmate Kyoya offers to be her pretend boyfriendâ€”for a price. With no other choice, Erika finds herself at the mercy of a blackhearted prince! But is Kyoya truly as blackhearted as he seems?
 
 When Erika turns Kyoya down for a date to help one of Sanâ€™s younger brothers shop for Sanâ€™s birthday, Kamiya points out her story doesnâ€™t add up. After some snooping, Kyoya is shocked to find Erika meeting up with a tall and handsome stranger! Shaken to his core, Kyoya canâ€™t even bring himself to go to school the next day. Can the pair survive this apparent betrayal?
